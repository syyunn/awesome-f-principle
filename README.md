"In another word, at the early stage of training, the low-frequencies are fitted and as iteration steps
of training increase, the high-frequencies are fitted. For example, when a DNN is trained to fit
y = sin(x) + sin(2x), its output would be close to sin(x) at early stage and as training goes on,
its output would be close to sin(x) + sin(2x)." - FREQUENCY PRINCIPLE: FOURIER ANALYSIS SHEDS
